# trew_hud_ui_nocarhud
Trew hud with no car hud

Litte modification from https://github.com/vortisrd/trew_hud_ui
Hope that if he finds it he let us keep it :) We just removed the car hud and every (I guess) internal code related to it.



**Rename it to trew_hud_ui
and do the proper start on server.cfg, also make sure as always to start it after the JOBS SCRIPTS.

start trew_hud_ui
